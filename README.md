# Inertia-core

Inertia is a (WIP) computational mathematics library for Rust. 

Inertia-core contains the core functionality of the [Inertia](https://github.com/wjyoumans/inertia) crate, providing high-level wrappers for the [FLINT](https://flintlib.org/doc/), [Arb](https://arblib.org/), and [Antic](https://github.com/wbhart/antic) C libraries.

This library is far from complete. Feel free to open issues for missing features and they will be prioritized accordingly. Pull requests are also welcome.
